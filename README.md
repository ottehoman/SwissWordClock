A clock that shows the time using words

Word clocks are kind-a cool, weird, quirky. Nerd stuff. I’ve seen them around for a few years now, and you can buy them for a few hundred dollars. They come in all sorts of sizes, shapes (usually square though), materials, colours and – sometimes – languages.
g00gle/bing/duckduckgo “word clock” or “word +clock” and you’ll find them on the internet.

But buying is only half the fun. Building your own is better – you have more control over what you want and what you get – size, shape, colours, and built-in functionality. Raiding ebay™ for parts is much more fun than buying a complete clock that then perhaps doesn’t know how to deal with your time zone or with your daylight savings settings.

A while ago we were travelling in Europe and saw a word clock in the local Bernese German language – so weird! Having lived in Switzerland for a long time (two decades!) we fluently speak the language and had no issues reading (or even pronouncing) the time from the clock. So, after returning home, I was told: “we need one of those”. But also “in Zürich German, please” (we lived in Zurich, not in Berne).

Anyway, TL;DR … here’s a word clock in Schwyzerdütsch from Zürich, “made in Sydney”.
